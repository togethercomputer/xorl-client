"""Skip-observation token-level GAE (SAO, arXiv:2607.07508, Eq. 4-5).

Agentic trajectories interleave model actions with environment observations
the model did not generate. Standard GAE bootstraps across every adjacent
token, which propagates critic noise through observation tokens. The
skip-observation estimator chains the Bellman recursion across *action tokens
only*: the TD target of an action token bootstraps from the value of the next
action token, bridging any observation gap in between.

Pure Python (no torch/numpy), mirroring ``xorl.rl.advantages`` in the server
repo. Sequences follow the server's target-aligned
convention: index t describes the t-th target token, matching the per-token
values returned by the ``value_prediction`` loss and the ``advantages`` /
``returns`` fields of a training datum.

Note: the server's packer masks tokens where ``advantages == 0.0``; that is
the desired behavior for non-action tokens (this module emits exactly 0.0
there), but a true action-token advantage of exactly 0.0 would also be
masked. Nudge such values by a tiny epsilon if that matters for your reward
scale.

        values: Per-token value predictions V(s_t), length T (from a
